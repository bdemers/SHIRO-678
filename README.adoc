= SHIRO-678 (garbled strings) test case with OpenLiberty.io

Example for posting a string without and with a `JSESSIONID` cookie.
If you add this cookie, Unicode will work.

== Expected output

Adding a cookie should not mess with the encoding. The test cases make sure of this.

== Actual output

When not adding a `JSESSIONID` cookie, the strings from the form entity will be mis-interpreted.

== Execution

* Run `mvn clean liberty:dev` to run hot tests (`*IT.java`) on liberty.
* Press `&lt;Enter&gt;` to execute the integration tests again.
* The stacktrace is visible on stdout and in the logs.
* Run `mvn clean test` to run the unit tests (none atm).

== Noteworthy

=== Liberty configuration

* `server.xml` is redundant to feature config in `pom.xml`.
   This is on purpose to show how easy it is to configure OpenLiberty.
* look at `jvm.options` for Liberty-related jvm options.
* Run `mvn clean liberty:run` to not execute tests and not re-deploy on code change.
* Tests are somehow executed twice.

=== Logging

* Create and modify `logback.xml` and `logback-test.xml` respectively.
* JCL logging (apache) is redirected to logback.
